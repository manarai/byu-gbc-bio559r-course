    "\n",
    "In the biotechnology industry, optimizing cell culture conditions is critical for maximizing both cell viability and product yield in large-scale biomanufacturing processes. Mouse hybridoma cells are a well-established production platform for monoclonal antibodies, and their performance is highly sensitive to nutrient availability, growth factors, and environmental cues. Suboptimal culture conditions can lead to nutrient depletion, waste metabolite accumulation, reduced viability, and ultimately lower antibody titers, all of which directly impact process economics and product quality. To address these challenges, systematic evaluation of culture supplements such as glucose, glutamine, serum, growth factors, and metabolic regulators provides a rational strategy for enhancing hybridoma productivity. This experiment is motivated by the need to generate quantitative insights into how different supplements influence cell density, viability, antibody production, and metabolic profiles. Such knowledge supports process development teams in the biotech sector by enabling data-driven decisions for media optimization, cost-effective scale-up, and regulatory-compliant biologics manufacturing.\n",
